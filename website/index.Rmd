## Biography
As a *board*-certified genetics specialist with extensive experience, I am currently employed at BIH Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. My scientific interests in human genetics include rare diseases of neuronal development, rare tumors, and the kidney. I particularly enjoy bioinformatics work involving high-throughput sequencing data analysis and the curation of genetic diseases, variants, and genes. <br><br>
My academic journey began at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg and culminated in a medical license. I was a scientific-medical assistant at the Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) after beginning my residency. Here, I submitted an application for a DFG Rotation Position, which I was awarded after transferring to the Human Genetics Institute of the University Hospital Leipzig and working on the project "Exome Pool-Seq and systems biology approach to identify and characterize genes and networks in neurodevelopmental disorders". <br><br>
 I completed my Specialization in Human Genetics at the Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, where I also served as Deputy Team Leader of Genetic Diagnostics - Clinical Genomics. Soon after completing my specialization, I took a position as Senior Physician and Head of the Genetics Outpatient Clinic at MVZ Dresden.
