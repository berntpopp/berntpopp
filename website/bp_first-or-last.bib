            Genetic integrity of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is essential for their validity as disease models and for potential therapeutic use. We describe the comprehensive analysis in the ForIPS consortium: an iPSC collection from donors with neurological diseases and healthy controls. Characterization included pluripotency confirmation, fingerprinting, conventional and molecular karyotyping in all lines. In the majority, somatic copy number variants (CNVs) were identified. A subset with available matched donor DNA was selected for comparative exome sequencing. We identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at different allelic frequencies in each clone with high variability in mutational load. Low frequencies of variants in parental fibroblasts highlight the importance of germline samples. Somatic variant number was independent from reprogramming, cell type and passage. Comparison with disease genes and prediction scores suggest biological relevance for some variants. We show that high-throughput sequencing has value beyond SNV detection and the requirement to individually evaluate each clone.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This single-center study aims to determine the time, diagnostic procedure, and cost saving potential of early exome sequencing in a cohort of 111 individuals with genetically confirmed neurodevelopmental disorders. We retrospectively collected data regarding diagnostic time points and procedures from the individuals’ medical histories and developed criteria for classifying diagnostic procedures in terms of requirement, followed by a cost allocation. All genetic variants were re-evaluated according to ACMG recommendations and considering the individuals’ phenotype. Individuals who developed first symptoms of their underlying genetic disorder when Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) diagnostics were already available received a diagnosis significantly faster than individuals with first symptoms before this cutoff. The largest amount of potentially dispensable diagnostics was found in genetic, metabolic, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Out of 407 performed genetic examinations, 296 (72.7\%) were classified as potentially dispensable. The same applied to 36 (27.9\%) of 129 cranial magnetic resonance imaging and 111 (31.8\%) of 349 metabolic examinations. Dispensable genetic examinations accounted 302,947.07€ (90.2\%) of the total 335,837.49€ in potentially savable costs in this cohort. The remaining 32,890.42€ (9.8\%) are related to non-required metabolic and cranial magnetic resonance imaging diagnostics. On average, the total potentially savable costs in our study amount to €3,025.56 per individual. Cost savings by first tier exome sequencing lie primarily in genetic, metabolic, and cMRI testing in this German cohort, underscoring the utility of performing exome sequencing at the beginning of the diagnostic pathway and the potential for saving diagnostic costs and time.},

              Objective
              
                17q12 microdeletions containing
                HNF1B
                and intragenic variants within this gene are associated with variable developmental, endocrine, and renal anomalies, often already noted prenatally as hyperechogenic/cystic kidneys. Here, we describe prenatal and postnatal phenotypes of seven individuals with
                HNF1B
                aberrations and compare their clinical and genetic data to those of previous studies.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                Prenatal sequencing and postnatal chromosomal microarray analysis were performed in seven individuals with renal and/or neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We evaluated
                HNF1B
                ‐related clinical features from 82 studies and reclassified 192 reported intragenic
                HNF1B
                variants.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                In a prenatal case, we identified a novel in‐frame deletion p.(Gly239del) within the HNF1B DNA‐binding domain, a mutational hot spot as demonstrated by spatial clustering analysis and high computational prediction scores. The six postnatally diagnosed individuals harbored 17q12 microdeletions. Literature screening revealed variable reporting of
                HNF1B‐
                associated clinical traits. Overall, both mutation groups showed a high phenotypic heterogeneity. The reclassification of all previously reported intragenic
                HNF1B
                variants provided an up‐to‐date overview of the mutational spectrum.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                We highlight the value of prenatal
                HNF1B
                screening in renal developmental diseases. Standardized clinical reporting and systematic classification of
                HNF1B
                variants are necessary for a more accurate risk quantification of prenatal and postnatal clinical features, improving genetic counseling and prenatal decision making.},

The four previously reported individuals show considerable clinical variability. Unbiased high‐throughput sequencing enables the rapid identification of additional cases for such rare entities. We identified the homozygous nonsense variant c.917dup, p.Tyr306* in
              AEBP1
              using clinical exome sequencing in a female individual with previously unsolved CTD. Segregation testing confirmed homozygosity in the clinically affected brother and heterozygous carrier status in the healthy mother. Chromosomal microarray showed that the variant lies in a run of homozygosity, suggesting a common origin of this genomic segment. RT‐PCR analysis in the mother revealed a monoallelic expression of the normal transcript supporting a nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay and functional nullizygosity as disease mechanism. We describe two individuals from a fourth family with
              AEBP1

              Hereditary chronic kidney disease (CKD) appears to be more frequent than the clinical perception. Exome sequencing (ES) studies in CKD cohorts could identify pathogenic variants in {\textasciitilde}10\% of individuals. Tubulointerstitial kidney diseases, showing no typical clinical/histologic finding but tubulointerstitial fibrosis, are particularly difficult to diagnose. We used a targeted panel (29 genes) and
              MUC1
              -SNaPshot to sequence 271 DNAs, selected in defined disease entities and age cutoffs from 5217 individuals in the German Chronic Kidney Disease cohort. We identified 33 pathogenic variants. Of these 27 (81.8\%) were in
              COL4A3/4/5
              , the largest group being 15
              COL4A5
              variants with nine unrelated individuals carrying c.1871G{\textgreater}A, p.(Gly624Asp). We found three cysteine variants in
              UMOD
              , a novel missense and a novel splice variant in
              HNF1B
              and the homoplastic
              MTTF
              variant m.616T{\textgreater}C. Copy-number analysis identified a heterozygous
              COL4A5
              deletion, and a
              HNF1B
              duplication/deletion, respectively. Overall, pathogenic variants were present in 12.5\% (34/271) and variants of unknown significance in 9.6\% (26/271) of selected individuals. Bioinformatic predictions paired with gold standard diagnostics for
              MUC1
              (SNaPshot) could not identify the typical cytosine duplication (“c.428dupC”) in any individual, implying that ADTKD-
              MUC1
              is rare. Our study shows that {\textgreater}10\% of selected individuals carry disease-causing variants in genes partly associated with tubulointerstitial kidney diseases.
              COL4A3/4/5
              genes constitute the largest fraction, implying they are regularly overlooked using clinical Alport syndrome criteria and displaying the existence of phenocopies. We identified variants easily missed by some ES pipelines. The clinical filtering criteria applied enriched for an underlying genetic disorder.},

              Iterative re-analysis of NGS results is not well investigated for published research cohorts of rare diseases. We revisited a cohort of 152 consanguineous families with developmental disorders (NDD) reported five years ago. We re-evaluated all reported variants according to diagnostic classification guidelines or our candidate gene scoring system (AutoCaSc) and systematically scored the validity of gene-disease associations (GDA). Sequencing data was re-processed using an up-to-date pipeline for case-level re-analysis. In 28/152 (18\%) families, we identified a clinically relevant change. Ten previously reported (likely) pathogenic variants were re-classified as VUS/benign. In one case, the GDA (
              TSEN15
              ) validity was judged as limited, and in five cases GDAs are meanwhile established. We identified 12 new disease causing variants. Two previously reported variants were missed by our updated pipeline due to alignment or reference issues. Our results support the need to re-evaluate screening studies, not only the negative cases but including supposedly solved ones. This also applies in a diagnostic setting. We highlight that the complexity of computational re-analysis for old data should be weighed against the decreasing re-testing costs. Since extensive re-analysis per case is beyond the resources of most institutions, we recommend a screening procedure that would quickly identify the majority (83\%) of new variants.},

              variants cause heterogeneous disorders ranging from neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly/seizures to adult-onset Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. To date, only postnatal descriptions exist. We present the first prenatal diagnosis of
              PNKP
              -related primary microcephaly. Pathological examination of a male fetus in the 18th gestational week revealed micrencephaly with extracerebral malformations and thus presumed syndromic microcephaly. A recessive disorder was suspected because of previous pregnancy termination for similar abnormalities. Prenatal trio-exome sequencing identified compound heterozygosity for the
              PNKP
              variants c.498G{\textgreater}A, p.[(=),0?] and c.302C{\textgreater}T, p.(Pro101Leu). Segregation confirmed both variants in the sister fetus. Through RNA analyses, we characterized exon 4 skipping affecting the
              PNKP
              forkhead-associated (FHA) and phosphatase domains (p.Leu67\_Lys166del) as the predominant effect of the paternal c.498G{\textgreater}A variant. We retrospectively investigated two unrelated individuals diagnosed with biallelic

              with a variant in the FHA domain (c.311T{\textgreater}C, p.(Leu104Pro); c.151G{\textgreater}C, p.(Val51Leu)). RNA-seq showed complex splicing for c.1029+2T{\textgreater}C and c.151G{\textgreater}C. Structural modeling revealed significant clustering of missense variants in the FHA domain with variants generating structural damage. Our clinical description extends the

	abstract = {Introduction
              Antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) is the most common cause of long-term allograft loss in kidney transplantation (KT). Therefore, a low human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch (MM) load is favorable for KT outcomes. Hitherto, serological or low-resolution molecular HLA typing have been adapted in parallel. Here, we aimed to identify previously missed HLA mismatches and corresponding antibodies by high resolution HLA genotyping in a living-donor KT cohort.
            
            
              Methods
              
                103 donor/recipient pairs transplanted at the University of Leipzig Medical Center between 1998 and 2018 were re-typed using next generation sequencing (NGS) of the HLA loci -A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DRB345, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, and -DPB1. Based on these data, we compiled HLA MM counts for each pair and comparatively evaluated genomic HLA-typing with pre-transplant obtained serological/low-resolution HLA (=one-field) typing results. NGS HLA typing (=two-field) data was further used for reclassification of
                de novo
                HLA antibodies as “donor-specific”.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                By two-field HLA re-typing, we were able to identify additional MM in 64.1\% (n=66) of cases for HLA loci -A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 that were not observed by one-field HLA typing. In patients with biopsy proven ABMR, two-field calculated MM count was significantly higher than by one-field HLA typing. For additional typed HLA loci -DRB345, -DQA1, -DPA1, and -DPB1 we observed 2, 26, 3, and 23 MM, respectively. In total, 37.3\% (69/185) of
                de novo
                donor specific antibodies (DSA) formation was directed against these loci (DRB345 ➔ n=33, DQA1 ➔ n=33, DPA1 ➔ n=1, DPB1 ➔ n=10).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results indicate that two-field HLA typing is feasible and provides significantly more sensitive HLA MM recognition in living-donor KT. Furthermore, accurate HLA typing plays an important role in graft management as it can improve discrimination between donor and non-donor HLA directed cellular and humoral alloreactivity in the long range. The inclusion of additional HLA loci against which antibodies can be readily detected, HLA-DRB345, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, and -DPB1, will allow a more precise virtual crossmatch and better prediction of potential DSA. Furthermore, in living KT, two-field HLA typing could contribute to the selection of the immunologically most suitable donors.},

              The non‐POU domain‐containing octamer‐binding (NONO) protein is involved in multiple steps of gene regulation such as RNA metabolism and DNA repair. Hemizygous pathogenic variants in the
              NONO

The combined cohort consists of 16 live‐born males showing developmental delay, corpus callosum anomalies, non‐compaction cardiomyopathy and relative macrocephaly as leading symptoms. Seven prenatal literature cases were characterized by cardiac malformations. In this study, we extend the phenotypic spectrum through two more cases with epilepsy as well as two more cases with hematologic anomalies. By RNA expression analysis and structural modeling of a new in‐frame splice deletion, we reinforce loss‐of‐function as the pathomechanism for the

Clinically, these individuals are characterized by intellectual disability, coarse/ square facial gestalt, abnormalities of the hands, and organomegaly. Public cell lines with NSD2 GoF variants had increased K36me2, DNA promoter methylation, and dysregulated RNA expression.

              haploinsufficiency by deletions, truncating variants or loss‐of‐function missense variants within the DNA‐binding and protein interacting bHLH domain causes Pitt‐Hopkins syndrome (PTHS). This neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) is characterized by severe intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, hyperbreathing and a typical facial gestalt. Only few aberrations of the N‐terminus of
              TCF4
              were associated with milder or atypical phenotypes. By personal communication and searching databases we assembled six cases with the novel, recurrent,

All six individuals presented with moderate to severe ID with language impairment. Microcephaly occurred in two individuals, epilepsy only in one, and no breathing anomalies or myopia were reported. Facial gestalt showed some aspects of PTHS but was rather non‐specific in most individuals. Interestingly, the variant is located within the AD2 activation domain next to a highly conserved coactivator‐recruitment motif and might alter interaction with coactivator proteins independently from the bHLH domain. Our findings of a recurrent missense variant outside the bHLH domain in six individuals with an ID phenotype overlapping with but not typical for PTHS delineate a novel genotype–phenotype correlation for
