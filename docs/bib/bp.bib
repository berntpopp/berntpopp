We now identified de novo missense variants in NAA10 in two unrelated individuals, a boy and a girl, with severe global developmental delay but without any major dysmorphism by trio whole-exome sequencing. Both de novo variants were predicted to be deleterious, and we excluded other variants in this gene. This X-linked gene encodes N-alphaacetyltransferase 10, the catalytic subunit of the NatA complex involved in multiple cellular processes. A single hypomorphic missense variant p.(Ser37Pro) was previously associated with Ogden syndrome in eight affected males from two different families. This rare disorder is characterized by a highly recognizable phenotype, global developmental delay and results in death during infancy. In an attempt to explain the discrepant phenotype, we used in vitro N-terminal acetylation assays which suggested that the severity of the phenotype correlates with the remaining catalytic activity. The variant in the Ogden syndrome patients exhibited a lower activity than the one seen in the boy with intellectual disability, while the variant in the girl was the most severe exhibiting only residual activity in the acetylation assays used. We propose that N-terminal acetyltransferase deficiency is clinically heterogeneous with the overall catalytic activity determining the phenotypic severity.},

	abstract = {High throughput sequencing has greatly advanced disease gene identification, especially in heterogeneous entities. Despite falling costs this is still an expensive and laborious technique, particularly when studying large cohorts. To address this problem we applied Exome Pool-Seq as an economic and fast screening technology in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Sequencing of 96 individuals can be performed in eight pools of 12 samples on less than one Illumina sequencer lane. In a pilot study with 96 cases we identified 27 variants, likely or possibly affecting function. Twenty five of these were identified in 923 established NDD genes (based on SysID database, status November 2016) (ACTB, AHDC1, ANKRD11, ATP6V1B2, ATRX, CASK, CHD8, GNAS, IFIH1, KCNQ2, KMT2A, KRAS, MAOA, MED12, MED13L, RIT1, SETD5, SIN3A, TCF4, TRAPPC11, TUBA1A, WAC, ZBTB18, ZMYND11), two in 543 (SysID) candidate genes (ZNF292, BPTF), and additionally a de novo loss-of-function variant in LRRC7, not previously implicated in NDDs. Most of them were confirmed to be de novo, but we also identified X-linked or autosomal-dominantly or autosomal-recessively inherited variants. With a detection rate of 28\%, Exome Pool-Seq achieves comparable results to individual exome analyses but reduces costs by {\textgreater}85\%. Compared with other large scale approaches using Molecular Inversion Probes (MIP) or gene panels, it allows flexible re-analysis of data. Exome Pool-Seq is thus well suited for large-scale, cost-efficient and flexible screening in characterized but heterogeneous entities like NDDs.},

            Genetic integrity of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is essential for their validity as disease models and for potential therapeutic use. We describe the comprehensive analysis in the ForIPS consortium: an iPSC collection from donors with neurological diseases and healthy controls. Characterization included pluripotency confirmation, fingerprinting, conventional and molecular karyotyping in all lines. In the majority, somatic copy number variants (CNVs) were identified. A subset with available matched donor DNA was selected for comparative exome sequencing. We identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at different allelic frequencies in each clone with high variability in mutational load. Low frequencies of variants in parental fibroblasts highlight the importance of germline samples. Somatic variant number was independent from reprogramming, cell type and passage. Comparison with disease genes and prediction scores suggest biological relevance for some variants. We show that high-throughput sequencing has value beyond SNV detection and the requirement to individually evaluate each clone.},

	abstract = {Two percent of patients with Wilms tumors have a positive family history. In many of these cases the genetic cause remains unresolved. By applying germline exome sequencing in two families with two affected individuals with Wilms tumors, we identified truncating mutations in
              TRIM28
              . Subsequent mutational screening of germline and tumor DNA of 269 children affected by Wilms tumor was performed, and revealed seven additional individuals with germline truncating mutations, and one individual with a somatic truncating mutation in
              TRIM28. TRIM28
              encodes a complex scaffold protein involved in many different processes, including gene silencing, DNA repair and maintenance of genomic integrity. Expression studies on mRNA and protein level showed reduction of TRIM28, confirming a loss‐of‐function effect of the mutations identified. The tumors showed an epithelial‐type histology that stained negative for TRIM28 by immunohistochemistry. The tumors were bilateral in six patients, and 10/11 tumors are accompanied by perilobar nephrogenic rests. Exome sequencing on eight tumor DNA samples from six individuals showed loss‐of‐heterozygosity (LOH) of the
              TRIM28
              ‐locus by mitotic recombination in seven tumors, suggesting that
              TRIM28
              functions as a tumor suppressor gene in Wilms tumor development. Additionally, the tumors showed very few mutations in known Wilms tumor driver genes, suggesting that loss of
              TRIM28
              is the main driver of tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we identified heterozygous germline truncating mutations in
              TRIM28
              in 11 children with mainly epithelial‐type Wilms tumors, which become homozygous in tumor tissue. These data establish
              TRIM28
              as a novel Wilms tumor predisposition gene, acting as a tumor suppressor gene by LOH.

              About 2\% of Wilms tumors run in families, and some of the mutations remain unknown. These authors identified a new Wilms tumor mutation, a truncation on the
              TRIM28
              gene. They started by performing exome sequencing on tumors in pairs of affected children from 2 families. In these 4 patients, they found mutations in
              TRIM28
              , which encodes a scaffold protein involved in DNA repair and genome stability. They then screened a cohort of 269 cases and found 8 more patients bearing
              TRIM28
              loss‐of‐function mutations. The gene appears to function as a tumor suppressor with loss of heterozygosity in the tumor cells.},

	abstract = {Background: The TUBA1A-associated tubulinopathy is clinically heterogeneous with brain malformations, microcephaly, developmental delay and epilepsy being the main clinical features. It is an autosomal dominant disorder mostly caused by de novo variants in TUBA1A. Results: In three individuals with developmental delay we identified heterozygous de novo missense variants in TUBA1A using exome sequencing. While the c.1307G {\textgreater} A, p.(Gly436Asp) variant was novel, the two variants c. 518C {\textgreater} T, p.(Pro173Leu) and c.641G {\textgreater} A, p.(Arg214His) were previously described. We compared the variable phenotype observed in these individuals with a carefully conducted review of the current literature and identified 166 individuals, 146 born and 20 fetuses with a TUBA1A variant. In 107 cases with available clinical information we standardized the reported phenotypes according to the Human Phenotype Ontology. The most commonly reported features were developmental delay (98\%), anomalies of the corpus callosum (96\%), microcephaly (76\%) and lissencephaly (agyria-pachygyria) (70\%), although reporting was incomplete in the different studies. We identified a total of 121 specific variants, including 15 recurrent ones. Missense variants cluster in the C-terminal region around the most commonly affected amino acid position Arg402 (13.3\%). In a three-dimensional protein model, 38.6\% of all disease-causing variants including those in the C-terminal region are predicted to affect the binding of microtubule-associated proteins or motor proteins. Genotype-phenotype analysis for recurrent variants showed an overrepresentation of certain clinical features. However, individuals with these variants are often reported in the same publication. Conclusions: With 166 individuals, we present the most comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic standardized synopsis for clinical interpretation of TUBA1A variants. Despite this considerable number, a detailed genotypephenotype characterization is limited by large inter-study variability in reporting.},

              Recently, the

              (
              MUC1
              ) gene has been identified as a causal gene of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD). Most causative mutations are buried within a GC-rich 60 basepair variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR), which escapes identification by massive parallel sequencing methods due to the complexity of the VNTR. We established long read single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT) targeted to the
              MUC1
              -VNTR as an alternative strategy to the snapshot assay. Our approach allows complete VNTR assembly, thereby enabling the detection of all variants residing within the VNTR and simultaneous determination of VNTR length. We present high resolution data on the VNTR architecture for a cohort of snapshot positive (n = 9) and negative (n = 7) ADTKD families. By SMRT sequencing we could confirm the diagnosis in all previously tested cases, reconstruct both VNTR alleles and determine the exact position of the causative variant in eight of nine families. This study demonstrates that precise positioning of the causative mutation(s) and identification of other coding and noncoding sequence variants in ADTKD-
              MUC1
              is feasible. SMRT sequencing could provide a powerful tool to uncover potential factors encoded within the VNTR that associate with intra- and interfamilial phenotype variability of

              Skeletal ciliopathies are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive osteochondrodysplasias caused by defects in formation, maintenance and function of the primary cilium. Mutations in the underlying genes affect the molecular motors, intraflagellar transport complexes (IFT), or the basal body. The more severe phenotypes are caused by defects of genes of the dynein-2 complex, where mutations in
              DYNC2H1
              ,
              WDR34

              DYNC2LI1
              is ubiquitously expressed and interacts with DYNC2H1 to form the dynein-2 complex important for retrograde IFT. Using
              DYNC2LI1
              siRNA knockdown in fibroblasts we identified a significantly reduced cilia length proposed to affect cilia function. In addition, depletion of
              DYNC2LI1
              induced altered cilia morphology with broadened ciliary tips and accumulation of IFT-B complex proteins in accordance with retrograde IFT defects. Our results expand the clinical spectrum of ciliopathies caused by defects of the dynein-2 complex.},

                Providing the correct diagnosis for patients with tubulointerstitial kidney disease and secondary degenerative disorders, such as hypertension, remains a challenge. The autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) subtype caused by
                MUC1
                mutations (ADTKD-
                MUC1
                ) is particularly difficult to diagnose, because the mutational hotspot is a complex repeat domain, inaccessible with routine sequencing techniques. Here, we further evaluated SNaPshot minisequencing as a technique for diagnosing ADTKD-
                MUC1
                and assessed immunodetection of the disease-associated mucin 1 frameshift protein (MUC1-fs) as a nongenetic technique.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                We re-evaluated detection of
                MUC1
                mutations by targeted repeat enrichment and SNaPshot minisequencing by haplotype reconstruction
                via
                microsatellite analysis in three independent ADTKD-
                MUC1
                families. Additionally, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MUC1-fs and evaluated immunodetection of wild-type and mutated allele products in human kidney biopsy specimens.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                The detection of
                MUC1
                mutations by SNaPshot minisequencing was robust. Immunostaining with our MUC1-fs antibodies and an MUC1 antibody showed that both proteins are readily detectable in human ADTKD-
                MUC1
                kidneys, with mucin 1 localized to the apical membrane and MUC1-fs abundantly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Notably, immunohistochemical analysis of MUC1-fs expression in clinical kidney samples facilitated reliable prediction of the disease status of individual patients.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Diagnosing ADTKD-
                MUC1
                by molecular genetics is possible, but it is technically demanding and labor intensive. However, immunohistochemistry on kidney biopsy specimens is feasible for nongenetic diagnosis of ADTKD-
                MUC1
                and therefore, a valid method to select families for further diagnostics. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that specific molecular effects of MUC1-fs underlie the pathogenesis of this disease.},

We systemically reviewed clinical and molecular data from this cohort and 11 cases previously reported. Phenotypes were standardized using Human Phenotype Ontology terms.

Based on clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic data, we provide recommendations for variant reporting, clinical assessment, and surveillance/ treatment of individuals with TECPR2‐associated disorder.

            This single-center study aims to determine the time, diagnostic procedure, and cost saving potential of early exome sequencing in a cohort of 111 individuals with genetically confirmed neurodevelopmental disorders. We retrospectively collected data regarding diagnostic time points and procedures from the individuals’ medical histories and developed criteria for classifying diagnostic procedures in terms of requirement, followed by a cost allocation. All genetic variants were re-evaluated according to ACMG recommendations and considering the individuals’ phenotype. Individuals who developed first symptoms of their underlying genetic disorder when Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) diagnostics were already available received a diagnosis significantly faster than individuals with first symptoms before this cutoff. The largest amount of potentially dispensable diagnostics was found in genetic, metabolic, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Out of 407 performed genetic examinations, 296 (72.7\%) were classified as potentially dispensable. The same applied to 36 (27.9\%) of 129 cranial magnetic resonance imaging and 111 (31.8\%) of 349 metabolic examinations. Dispensable genetic examinations accounted 302,947.07€ (90.2\%) of the total 335,837.49€ in potentially savable costs in this cohort. The remaining 32,890.42€ (9.8\%) are related to non-required metabolic and cranial magnetic resonance imaging diagnostics. On average, the total potentially savable costs in our study amount to €3,025.56 per individual. Cost savings by first tier exome sequencing lie primarily in genetic, metabolic, and cMRI testing in this German cohort, underscoring the utility of performing exome sequencing at the beginning of the diagnostic pathway and the potential for saving diagnostic costs and time.},

              Objective
              
                17q12 microdeletions containing
                HNF1B
                and intragenic variants within this gene are associated with variable developmental, endocrine, and renal anomalies, often already noted prenatally as hyperechogenic/cystic kidneys. Here, we describe prenatal and postnatal phenotypes of seven individuals with
                HNF1B
                aberrations and compare their clinical and genetic data to those of previous studies.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                Prenatal sequencing and postnatal chromosomal microarray analysis were performed in seven individuals with renal and/or neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We evaluated
                HNF1B
                ‐related clinical features from 82 studies and reclassified 192 reported intragenic
                HNF1B
                variants.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                In a prenatal case, we identified a novel in‐frame deletion p.(Gly239del) within the HNF1B DNA‐binding domain, a mutational hot spot as demonstrated by spatial clustering analysis and high computational prediction scores. The six postnatally diagnosed individuals harbored 17q12 microdeletions. Literature screening revealed variable reporting of
                HNF1B‐
                associated clinical traits. Overall, both mutation groups showed a high phenotypic heterogeneity. The reclassification of all previously reported intragenic
                HNF1B
                variants provided an up‐to‐date overview of the mutational spectrum.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                We highlight the value of prenatal
                HNF1B
                screening in renal developmental diseases. Standardized clinical reporting and systematic classification of
                HNF1B
                variants are necessary for a more accurate risk quantification of prenatal and postnatal clinical features, improving genetic counseling and prenatal decision making.},

The fumarate hydratase (FH) deficient subtype is found in up to 1.6\% and can occur in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome. We sequenced 13 FH deficient ULs from a previous immunohistochemical screen using a targeted panel and identified biallelic FH variants in all. In eight, we found an FH point mutation (two truncating, six missense) with evidence for loss of the second allele. Variant allele-frequencies in all cases with a point mutation pointed to somatic variants. Spatial clustering of the identified missense variants in the lyase domain indicated altered fumarase oligomerization with subsequent degradation as explanation for the observed FH deficiency. Biallelic FH deletions in five tumors confirm the importance of copy number loss as mutational mechanism. By curating all pathogenic FH variants and calculating their population frequency, we estimate a carrier frequency of up to 1/2,563. Comparing with the prevalence of FH deficient ULs, we conclude that most are sporadic and estimate 2.7–13.9\% of females with an FH deficient UL to carry a germline FH variant. Further prospective tumor/ normal sequencing studies are needed to develop a reliable screening strategy for HLRCC in women with ULs.},

Chromosomal microarray showed that the variant lies in a run of homozygosity, suggesting a common origin of this genomic segment. RT‐PCR analysis in the mother revealed a monoallelic expression of the normal transcript supporting a nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay and functional nullizygosity as disease mechanism. We describe two individuals from a fourth family with

              The SET domain containing 2, histone lysine methyltransferase encoded by
              SETD2
              is a dual‐function methyltransferase for histones and microtubules and plays an important role for transcriptional regulation, genomic stability, and cytoskeletal functions. Specifically,
              SETD2
              is associated with trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) and methylation of α‐tubulin at lysine 40. Heterozygous loss of function and missense variants have previously been described with Luscan‐Lumish syndrome (LLS), which is characterized by overgrowth, neurodevelopmental features, and absence of overt congenital anomalies. We have identified 15 individuals with de novo variants in codon 1740 of
              SETD2
              whose features differ from those with LLS. Group 1 consists of 12 individuals with heterozygous variant c.5218C{\textgreater}T p.(Arg1740Trp) and Group 2 consists of 3 individuals with heterozygous variant c.5219G{\textgreater}A p.(Arg1740Gln). The phenotype of Group 1 includes microcephaly, profound intellectual disability, congenital anomalies affecting several organ systems, and similar facial features. Individuals in Group 2 had moderate to severe intellectual disability, low normal head circumference, and absence of additional major congenital anomalies. While LLS is likely due to loss of function of
              SETD2
              , the clinical features seen in individuals with variants affecting codon 1740 are more severe suggesting an alternative mechanism, such as gain of function, effects on epigenetic regulation, or posttranslational modification of the cytoskeleton. Our report is a prime example of different mutations in the same gene causing diverging phenotypes and the features observed in Group 1 suggest a new clinically recognizable syndrome uniquely associated with the heterozygous variant c.5218C{\textgreater}T p.(Arg1740Trp) in
              SETD2.},

              Background
              
                BRCA1/2
                deleterious variants account for most of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases. Prediction models and guidelines for the assessment of genetic risk rely heavily on criteria with high variability such as family cancer history. Here we investigated the efficacy of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) texture features as a predictor for
                BRCA
                mutation status.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                A total of 41 female breast cancer individuals at high genetic risk, sixteen with a
                BRCA1/2
                pathogenic variant and twenty five controls were included. From each MRI 4225 computer-extracted voxels were analyzed. Non-imaging features including clinical, family cancer history variables and triple negative receptor status (TNBC) were complementarily used. Lasso-principal component regression (L-PCR) analysis was implemented to compare the predictive performance, assessed as area under the curve (AUC), when imaging features were used, and lasso logistic regression or conventional logistic regression for the remaining analyses.
              
            
            
              Results
              Lasso-selected imaging principal components showed the highest predictive value (AUC 0.86), surpassing family cancer history. Clinical variables comprising age at disease onset and bilateral breast cancer yielded a relatively poor AUC ({\textasciitilde} 0.56). Combination of imaging with the non-imaging variables led to an improvement of predictive performance in all analyses, with TNBC along with the imaging components yielding the highest AUC (0.94). Replacing family history variables with imaging components yielded an improvement of classification performance of {\textasciitilde} 4\%, suggesting that imaging compensates the predictive information arising from family cancer structure.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                The L-PCR model uncovered evidence for the utility of MRI texture features in distinguishing between
                BRCA1/2
                positive and negative high-risk breast cancer individuals, which may suggest value to diagnostic routine. Integration of computer-extracted texture analysis from MRI modalities in prediction models and inclusion criteria might play a role in reducing false positives or missed cases especially when established risk variables such as family history are missing.},

              TUBA1A
              tubulinopathy is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder associated with brain malformations as well as early-onset and intractable epilepsy. As pathomechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations are not completely understood, we aimed to provide further insights into the phenotypic and genetic spectrum. We here present a multicenter case series of ten unrelated individuals from four European countries using systematic MRI re-evaluation, protein structure analysis, and prediction score modeling. In two cases, pregnancy was terminated due to brain malformations. Amongst the eight living individuals, the phenotypic range showed various severity. Global developmental delay and severe motor impairment with tetraparesis was present in 63\% and 50\% of the subjects, respectively. Epilepsy was observed in 75\% of the cases, which showed infantile onset in 83\% and a refractory course in 50\%. One individual presented a novel
              TUBA1A
              -associated electroclinical phenotype with evolvement from early myoclonic encephalopathy to continuous spike-and-wave during sleep. Neuroradiological features comprised a heterogeneous spectrum of cortical and extracortical malformations including rare findings such as cobblestone lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. Two individuals developed hydrocephalus with subsequent posterior infarction. We report four novel and five previously published
              TUBA1A
              missense variants whose resulting amino acid substitutions likely affect longitudinal, lateral, and motor protein interactions as well as GTP binding. Assessment of pathogenic and benign variant distributions in synopsis with prediction scores revealed sections of variant enrichment and intolerance to missense variation.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Adaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia is caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in AP4B1, AP4M1, AP4E1 or AP4S1, which constitute the four subunits of this obligate complex. While the diagnosis of adaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia relies on molecular testing, the interpretation of novel missense variants remains challenging. Here, we address this diagnostic gap by using patient-derived fibroblasts to establish a functional assay that measures the subcellular localization of ATG9A, a transmembrane protein that is sorted by adaptor protein complex 4. Using automated high-throughput microscopy, we determine the ratio of the ATG9A fluorescence in the trans-Golgi-network versus cytoplasm and ascertain that this metric meets standards for screening assays (Z′-factor robust \&gt;0.3, strictly standardized mean difference \&gt;3). The ‘ATG9A ratio’ is increased in fibroblasts of 18 well-characterized adaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia patients [mean: 1.54 ± 0.13 versus 1.21 ± 0.05 (standard deviation) in controls] and receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrates robust diagnostic power (area under the curve: 0.85, 95\% confidence interval: 0.849–0.852). Using fibroblasts from two individuals with atypical clinical features and novel biallelic missense variants of unknown significance in AP4B1, we show that our assay can reliably detect adaptor protein complex 4 function. Our findings establish the ‘ATG9A ratio’ as a diagnostic marker of adaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia.},

              Context
              CPE encodes carboxypeptidase E, an enzyme that converts proneuropeptides and propeptide hormones to bioactive forms. It is widely expressed in the endocrine and central nervous system. To date, 4 individuals from 2 families with core clinical features including morbid obesity, neurodevelopmental delay, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, harboring biallelic loss-of-function (LoF) CPE variants, have been reported.
            
            
              Objective
              We describe 4 affected individuals from 3 unrelated consanguineous families, 2 siblings of Syrian, 1 of Egyptian, and 1 of Pakistani descent, all harboring novel homozygous CPE LoF variants.
            
            
              Methods
              After excluding Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), exome sequencing was performed in both Syrian siblings. The variants identified in the other 2 individuals were reported as research variants in a large-scale exome study and in the ClinVar database. Computational modeling of all possible missense alterations allowed assessing CPE tolerance to missense variants.
            
            
              Results
              All affected individuals were severely obese with neurodevelopmental delay and other endocrine anomalies. Three individuals from 2 families shared the same CPE homozygous truncating variant c.361C \&gt; T, p.(Arg121*), while the fourth carried the c.994del, p.(Ser333Alafs*22) variant. Comparison of clinical features with previously described cases and standardization according to the Human Phenotype Ontology terms indicated a recognizable clinical phenotype, which we termed Blakemore-Durmaz-Vasileiou (BDV) syndrome. Computational analysis indicated high conservation of CPE domains and intolerance to missense changes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Biallelic truncating CPE variants are associated with BDV syndrome, a clinically recognizable monogenic recessive syndrome with childhood-onset obesity, neurodevelopmental delay, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. BDV syndrome resembles PWS. Our findings suggest missense variants may also be clinically relevant.},

Enlargement of the cohort by these four individuals contributes to the delineation of the VBS phenotype and suggests expressive speech delay, moderate motor delay, learning difficulties/mild ID, mild microcephaly, short stature and notable social behavior deficits as clinical hallmarks. In addition, one patient presented with nephroblastoma. The possible involvement of

	abstract = {Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) represent the most common cause of chronic kidney failure in children. Despite growing knowledge of the geneticcauses of CAKUT, the majority of cases remain etiologically unsolved. Genetic alterations in roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) have been associated with neuronal and cardiac developmental defects in living individuals. Although Slit-Robo signaling is pivotal for kidney development, diagnostic ROBO1variants have not been reported in viable CAKUT to date. By next-generation-sequencing methods, we identified six unrelated individuals and two non-viable fetuses with biallelic truncating or combined missense and truncating variants in ROBO1. Kidney and genitourinary manifestation included unilateral or bilateral kidney agenesis, vesicoureteral junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valve, genital malformation, and increased kidney echogenicity. Further clinical characteristics were remarkably heterogeneous, including neurodevelopmental defects, intellectual impairment, cerebral malformations, eye anomalies, and cardiac defects. By insilicoanalysis, we determined the functional significance of identified missense variants and observed absence of kidney ROBO1 expression in both human and murine mutant tissues. While its expression in multiple tissues may explain heterogeneous organ involvement, variability of the kidney disease suggests gene dosage effects due to a combination of null alleles with mild hypomorphic alleles. Thus, comprehensive genetic analysis in CAKUT should include ROBO1as a new cause of recessively inherited disease. Hence, in patients with already established ROBO1-associated cardiac or neuronal disorders, screening for kidney involvement is indicated.},

            Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) comprises a group of inherited kidney diseases, caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins localizing to primary cilia. NPHP-RC represents one of the most frequent monogenic causes of renal failure within the first three decades of life, but its molecular disease mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified biallelic ANKS6 mutations in two affected siblings with late-onset chronic kidney disease by whole-exome sequencing. We employed patient-derived fibroblasts generating an in vitro model to study the precise biological impact of distinct human ANKS6 mutations, completed by immunohistochemistry studies on renal biopsy samples. Functional studies using patient-derived cells showed an impaired integrity of the ciliary inversin compartment with reduced cilia length. Further analyses demonstrated that ANKS6 deficiency leads to a dysregulation of Hippo-signaling through nuclear yes-associated protein (YAP) imbalance and disrupted ciliary localization of YAP. In addition, an altered transcriptional activity of canonical Wnt target genes and altered expression of non-phosphorylated (active) β-catenin and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β were observed. Upon ciliation, ANKS6 deficiency revealed a deranged subcellular localization and expression of components of the endocytic recycling compartment. Our results demonstrate that ANKS6 plays a key role in regulating the Hippo pathway, and ANKS6 deficiency is linked to dysregulation of signaling pathways. Our study provides molecular clues in understanding pathophysiological mechanisms of NPHP-RC and may offer new therapeutic targets.},

              Background
              RNA-seq emerges as a valuable method for clinical genetics. The transcriptome is “dynamic” and tissue-specific, but typically the probed tissues to analyze (TA) are different from the tissue of interest (TI) based on pathophysiology.
            
            
              Results
              We developed Phenotype-Tissue Expression and Exploration (PTEE), a tool to facilitate the decision about the most suitable TA for RNA-seq. We integrated phenotype-annotated genes, used 54 tissues from GTEx to perform correlation analyses and identify expressed genes and transcripts between TAs and TIs. We identified skeletal muscle as the most appropriate TA to inquire for cardiac arrhythmia genes and skin as a good proxy to study neurodevelopmental disorders. We also explored RNA-seq limitations and show that on-off switching of gene expression during ontogenesis or circadian rhythm can cause blind spots for RNA-seq-based analyses.
            
            
              Conclusions

Research analysis of unsolved cases can identify novel candidate genes but is time-consuming, subjective, and hard to compare between labs. The field, therefore, requires automated and standardized assessment methods to prioritize candidates for matchmaking.

We developed AutoCaSc (https://autocasc.uni-leipzig.de) based on our candidate scoring scheme. We validated our approach using synthetic trios and real in-house trio ES data. AutoCaSc consistently (94.5\% of all cases) scored the relevant variants in valid novel NDD genes in the top three ranks. In 93 real trio exomes, AutoCaSc identified most (97.5\%) previously manually scored variants while evaluating additional high-scoring variants missed in manual evaluation. It identified candidate variants in previously undescribed NDD candidate genes (CNTN2, DLGAP1, SMURF1, NRXN3, and PRICKLE1).

AutoCaSc enables anybody to quickly screen a variant for its plausibility in NDD. After contributing {\textgreater}40 descriptions of NDD-associated genes, we provide usage recommendations based on our extensive experience. Our implementation is capable of pipeline integration and therefore allows the screening of large cohorts for candidate genes. AutoCaSc empowers even small labs to a standardized matchmaking collaboration and to contribute to the ongoing identification of novel NDD entities.},

              Hereditary chronic kidney disease (CKD) appears to be more frequent than the clinical perception. Exome sequencing (ES) studies in CKD cohorts could identify pathogenic variants in {\textasciitilde}10\% of individuals. Tubulointerstitial kidney diseases, showing no typical clinical/histologic finding but tubulointerstitial fibrosis, are particularly difficult to diagnose. We used a targeted panel (29 genes) and
              MUC1
              -SNaPshot to sequence 271 DNAs, selected in defined disease entities and age cutoffs from 5217 individuals in the German Chronic Kidney Disease cohort. We identified 33 pathogenic variants. Of these 27 (81.8\%) were in
              COL4A3/4/5
              , the largest group being 15
              COL4A5
              variants with nine unrelated individuals carrying c.1871G{\textgreater}A, p.(Gly624Asp). We found three cysteine variants in
              UMOD
              , a novel missense and a novel splice variant in
              HNF1B
              and the homoplastic
              MTTF
              variant m.616T{\textgreater}C. Copy-number analysis identified a heterozygous
              COL4A5
              deletion, and a
              HNF1B
              duplication/deletion, respectively. Overall, pathogenic variants were present in 12.5\% (34/271) and variants of unknown significance in 9.6\% (26/271) of selected individuals. Bioinformatic predictions paired with gold standard diagnostics for
              MUC1
              (SNaPshot) could not identify the typical cytosine duplication (“c.428dupC”) in any individual, implying that ADTKD-
              MUC1
              is rare. Our study shows that {\textgreater}10\% of selected individuals carry disease-causing variants in genes partly associated with tubulointerstitial kidney diseases.
              COL4A3/4/5
              genes constitute the largest fraction, implying they are regularly overlooked using clinical Alport syndrome criteria and displaying the existence of phenocopies. We identified variants easily missed by some ES pipelines. The clinical filtering criteria applied enriched for an underlying genetic disorder.},

            Recently, others and we identified de novo FBXO11 (F-Box only protein 11) variants as causative for a variable neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). We now assembled clinical and mutational information on 23 additional individuals. The phenotypic spectrum remains highly variable, with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability as the core feature and behavioral anomalies, hypotonia and various facial dysmorphism as frequent aspects. The mutational spectrum includes intragenic deletions, likely gene disrupting and missense variants distributed across the protein. To further characterize the functional consequences of FBXO11 missense variants, we analyzed their effects on protein expression and localization by overexpression of 17 different mutant constructs in HEK293 and HeLa cells. We found that the majority of missense variants resulted in subcellular mislocalization and/or reduced FBXO11 protein expression levels. For instance, variants located in the nuclear localization signal and the N-terminal F-Box domain lead to altered subcellular localization with exclusion from the nucleus or the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates and to reduced protein levels in western blot. In contrast, variants localized in the C-terminal Zn-finger UBR domain lead to an accumulation in the cytoplasm without alteration of protein levels. Together with the mutational data, our functional results suggest that most missense variants likely lead to a loss of the original FBXO11 function and thereby highlight haploinsufficiency as the most likely disease mechanism for FBXO11-associated NDDs.},

              . We obtained clinical descriptions of 16 new and nine published individuals, plus detailed case history of two children. New individuals were identified through GeneMatcher, ClinVar and the European Network for Therapies in Rare Epilepsy (NETRE). Genetic evaluation was performed using gene panels or exome sequencing; variants were classified using American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria. Individuals with
              ZMYND11
              associated epilepsy fell into three groups: (i) atypical benign partial epilepsy or idiopathic focal epilepsy (n = 8); (ii) generalised epilepsies/infantile epileptic encephalopathy (n = 4); (iii) unclassified (n = 8). Seizure prognosis ranged from spontaneous remission to drug resistant. Neurodevelopmental deficits were invariable. Dysmorphic features were variable. Variants were distributed across the gene and mostly de novo with no precise genotype–phenotype correlation.
              ZMYND11
              is one of a small group of chromatin reader genes associated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, and specifically ABPE.

              Iterative re-analysis of NGS results is not well investigated for published research cohorts of rare diseases. We revisited a cohort of 152 consanguineous families with developmental disorders (NDD) reported five years ago. We re-evaluated all reported variants according to diagnostic classification guidelines or our candidate gene scoring system (AutoCaSc) and systematically scored the validity of gene-disease associations (GDA). Sequencing data was re-processed using an up-to-date pipeline for case-level re-analysis. In 28/152 (18\%) families, we identified a clinically relevant change. Ten previously reported (likely) pathogenic variants were re-classified as VUS/benign. In one case, the GDA (
              TSEN15
              ) validity was judged as limited, and in five cases GDAs are meanwhile established. We identified 12 new disease causing variants. Two previously reported variants were missed by our updated pipeline due to alignment or reference issues. Our results support the need to re-evaluate screening studies, not only the negative cases but including supposedly solved ones. This also applies in a diagnostic setting. We highlight that the complexity of computational re-analysis for old data should be weighed against the decreasing re-testing costs. Since extensive re-analysis per case is beyond the resources of most institutions, we recommend a screening procedure that would quickly identify the majority (83\%) of new variants.},

We applied a strict filter cascade to reveal the most promising single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the whole cohort, which led to an average of 0.77 variants per individual that had to be manually evaluated. This variant set revealed seven novel diagnoses (0.8\% of all nondiagnostic cases) and two secondary findings. Thirteen additional variants were identified by a scientific approach prior to this re-analysis and were also present in this variant set. This resulted in a total increase in the diagnostic yield of 2.3\%. The filter cascade was optimised during the course of the study and finally resulted in sensitivity of 85\%. After applying the filter cascade, our re-analysis took 20 h and enabled a workflow that can be used repeatedly.

              variants cause heterogeneous disorders ranging from neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly/seizures to adult-onset Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. To date, only postnatal descriptions exist. We present the first prenatal diagnosis of
              PNKP
              -related primary microcephaly. Pathological examination of a male fetus in the 18th gestational week revealed micrencephaly with extracerebral malformations and thus presumed syndromic microcephaly. A recessive disorder was suspected because of previous pregnancy termination for similar abnormalities. Prenatal trio-exome sequencing identified compound heterozygosity for the
              PNKP
              variants c.498G{\textgreater}A, p.[(=),0?] and c.302C{\textgreater}T, p.(Pro101Leu). Segregation confirmed both variants in the sister fetus. Through RNA analyses, we characterized exon 4 skipping affecting the
              PNKP
              forkhead-associated (FHA) and phosphatase domains (p.Leu67\_Lys166del) as the predominant effect of the paternal c.498G{\textgreater}A variant. We retrospectively investigated two unrelated individuals diagnosed with biallelic
              PNKP

RNA-seq showed complex splicing for c.1029+2T{\textgreater}C and c.151G{\textgreater}C. Structural modeling revealed significant clustering of missense variants in the FHA domain with variants generating structural damage. Our clinical description extends the

                PKHD1

	abstract = {Abstract
            Germline pathogenic variants in two genes encoding the lysine-specific histone methyltransferase genes SETD1A and SETD2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) characterized by developmental delay and congenital anomalies. The SETD1A and SETD2 gene products play a critical role in chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression. Specific methylation episignatures have been detected for a range of chromatin gene-related NDDs and have impacted clinical practice by improving the interpretation of variant pathogenicity. To investigate if SETD1A and/or SETD2-related NDDs are associated with a detectable episignature, we undertook targeted genome-wide methylation profiling of \&gt; 2 M CpGs using a next-generation sequencing-based assay. A comparison of methylation profiles in patients with SETD1A variants (n = 6) did not reveal evidence of a strong methylation episignature. A review of the clinical and genetic features of the SETD2 patient group revealed that, as reported previously, there were phenotypic differences between patients with truncating mutations (n = 4, Luscan-Lumish syndrome; MIM:616831) and those with missense codon 1740 variants [p.Arg1740Trp (n = 4) and p.Arg1740Gln (n = 2)]. Both SETD2 subgroups demonstrated a methylation episignature, which was characterized by hypomethylation and hypermethylation events, respectively. Within the codon 1740 subgroup, both the methylation changes and clinical phenotype were more severe in those with p.Arg1740Trp variants. We also noted that two of 10 cases with a SETD2-NDD had developed a neoplasm. These findings reveal novel epigenotype–genotype–phenotype correlations in SETD2-NDDs and predict a gain-of-function mechanism for SETD2 codon 1740 pathogenic variants.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) is the most common cause of long-term allograft loss in kidney transplantation (KT). Therefore, a low human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch (MM) load is favorable for KT outcomes. Hitherto, serological or low-resolution molecular HLA typing have been adapted in parallel. Here, we aimed to identify previously missed HLA mismatches and corresponding antibodies by high resolution HLA genotyping in a living-donor KT cohort.
            
            
              Methods
              
                103 donor/recipient pairs transplanted at the University of Leipzig Medical Center between 1998 and 2018 were re-typed using next generation sequencing (NGS) of the HLA loci -A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DRB345, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, and -DPB1. Based on these data, we compiled HLA MM counts for each pair and comparatively evaluated genomic HLA-typing with pre-transplant obtained serological/low-resolution HLA (=one-field) typing results. NGS HLA typing (=two-field) data was further used for reclassification of
                de novo
                HLA antibodies as “donor-specific”.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                By two-field HLA re-typing, we were able to identify additional MM in 64.1\% (n=66) of cases for HLA loci -A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 that were not observed by one-field HLA typing. In patients with biopsy proven ABMR, two-field calculated MM count was significantly higher than by one-field HLA typing. For additional typed HLA loci -DRB345, -DQA1, -DPA1, and -DPB1 we observed 2, 26, 3, and 23 MM, respectively. In total, 37.3\% (69/185) of
                de novo
                donor specific antibodies (DSA) formation was directed against these loci (DRB345 ➔ n=33, DQA1 ➔ n=33, DPA1 ➔ n=1, DPB1 ➔ n=10).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results indicate that two-field HLA typing is feasible and provides significantly more sensitive HLA MM recognition in living-donor KT. Furthermore, accurate HLA typing plays an important role in graft management as it can improve discrimination between donor and non-donor HLA directed cellular and humoral alloreactivity in the long range. The inclusion of additional HLA loci against which antibodies can be readily detected, HLA-DRB345, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, and -DPB1, will allow a more precise virtual crossmatch and better prediction of potential DSA. Furthermore, in living KT, two-field HLA typing could contribute to the selection of the immunologically most suitable donors.},

              haploinsufficiency by deletions, truncating variants or loss‐of‐function missense variants within the DNA‐binding and protein interacting bHLH domain causes Pitt‐Hopkins syndrome (PTHS). This neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) is characterized by severe intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, hyperbreathing and a typical facial gestalt. Only few aberrations of the N‐terminus of
              TCF4
              were associated with milder or atypical phenotypes. By personal communication and searching databases we assembled six cases with the novel, recurrent,

Facial gestalt showed some aspects of PTHS but was rather non‐specific in most individuals. Interestingly, the variant is located within the AD2 activation domain next to a highly conserved coactivator‐recruitment motif and might alter interaction with coactivator proteins independently from the bHLH domain.

	abstract = {Background: Several subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex are implicated in both cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Though there is no clinical evidence for an increased tumor risk in individuals with NDDs due to germline mutations in most of these genes so far, this has been repeatedly proposed and discussed. A young woman with NDD due to a de novo mutation in ARID1B now presented with a large renal ({\textgreater} 19 cm in diameter) and multiple hepatic angiomyolipomas (AMLs) but no other signs of tuberous sclerosis complex. Methods: We analyzed tumor and healthy tissue samples with exome and panel sequencing. Results: Additionally to the previously known, germline ARID1B variant we identified a post-zygotic truncating TSC2 variant in both renal and hepatic AMLs but not in any of the healthy tissues. We did not detect any further, obvious tumor driver events. The identification of a passenger variant in SIPA1L3 in both AMLs points to a common clonal origin. Metastasis of the renal AML into the liver is unlikely on the basis of discordant histopathological features. Our findings therefore point to very low-grade mosaicism for the TSC2 variant, possibly in a yet unknown mesenchymal precursor cell that expanded clonally during tumor development. A possible contribution of the germline ARID1B variant to the tumorigenesis remains unclear but cannot be excluded given the absence of any other evident tumor drivers in the AMLs. Conclusion: This unique case highlights the blurred line between tumor genetics and post-zygotic events that can complicate exact molecular diagnoses in patients with rare manifestations. It also demonstrates the relevance of multiple disorders in a single individual, the challenges of detecting low-grade mosaicisms, and the importance of proper diagnosis for treatment and surveillance.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Coffin-Siris and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes, are recognisable neurodevelopmental disorders caused by germline variants in BAF complex subunits. The SMARCC2 BAFopathy was recently reported. Herein, we present clinical and molecular data on a large cohort. METHODS: Clinical symptoms for 41 novel and 24 previously published affected individuals were analyzed using the Human Phenotype Ontology. For genotypephenotype correlation, molecular data were standardized and grouped into nontruncating and likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants. Missense variant protein expression and BAF subunit interactions were examined using 3D protein modeling, co-immunoprecipitation, and proximity-ligation assays. RESULTS: Neurodevelopmental delay with intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia and behavioral disorders were the major manifestations. Clinical hallmarks of BAFopathies were rare. Clinical presentation differed significantly, with LGD variants being predominantly inherited and associated with mildly reduced or normal cognitive development, while non-truncating variants were mostly de novo and presented with severe developmental delay. These distinct manifestations and non-truncating variant clustering in functional domains suggest different pathomechanisms. In vitro testing showed decreased protein expression for N-terminal missense variants similar to LGD. CONCLUSION: This study improved SMARCC2 variant classification and identified discernible SMARCC2-associated phenotypes for LGD and non-truncating variants, which were distinct from other BAFopathies. The pathomechanism of most nontruncating variants has yet to be investigated.},

            Background
            
              Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare, hereditary multisystemic disorder affecting 1.2 in 100,000 live births, predominantly females. Conventional genetic analyses through short-read sequencing are complicated in case of IP due to the presence of a highly homologous pseudogene. Traditionally, long-range PCR is employed in order to overcome this challenge, however, detection of skewed X-Inactivation can also aid in correctly assign a variant to
              IKBKG
              .
            
          
          
            Methods
            
              We employed a comprehensive multi-method approach, incorporating whole-exome sequencing (WES), long-range PCR, RT-PCR, X-inactivation analysis, and nanopore sequencing of genomic DNA, to identify and accurately phase a small heterozygous deletion NM\_001099857.5:c.363\_367del, p.(Leu122Glyfs*14) to the
              IKBKG
              gene in a family affected with IP.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              The deletion was initially detected through WES and skewed X-inactivation was observed in both the proband and her mother. Long-range PCR specific to
              IKBKG
              was utilized to verify that the variant is located in
              IKBKG
              and not in its highly homologous pseudogene. On RNA level, the variant was undetectable, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the transcript containing the variant. We further utilized nanopore sequencing not only to pinpoint and accurately map the variant to the
              IKBKG
              gene but also to analyze methylation status of both alleles. This allowed us to confirm the skewed X-inactivation, with the variant-carrying allele found to be predominantly inactivated.
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            Nanopore sequencing serves as a valuable tool in genetic diagnosis, enabling the precise localization of the variant in either the gene or the pseudogene. Furthermore, in females with skewed X-inactivation, this method facilitates the determination of whether the variant is predominantly located on the activated or inactivated X-chromosome.},
