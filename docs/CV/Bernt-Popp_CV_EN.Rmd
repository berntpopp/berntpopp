### Curriculum Vitae

As a physician and scientist I am currently working at the University Hospital Leipzig and at the BIH at the Charité Berlin.

From a human genetics perspective, my scientific interests are in rare diseases of neuronal development, rare tumors and the kidney.
I particularly enjoy working bioinformatically on the analysis of data from high-throughput sequencing and on the curation of genetic diseases, variants and genes.
