## 📖 Background
I was born in a small Romanian town. My mother is a Transylvanian Saxon, and my father is Romanian. Nature, genetics, and the evolution of DNA, a thread that connects all life on Earth, have always captivated me. My interest in technology and computers began in the late 1990s with a family-owned computer, where I learned to code in Basic. During my medical studies, I discovered the field of human genetics, which provided a way to combine these interests.
My journey in this field has been marked by pivotal moments, like securing my [first DFG project](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/422575385), being honored with the ["GfH-Promotionspreis" 2017](https://gfhev.de/de/ueber-uns/ehrungen.html), and the SYNLAB-award at EuroDysmorpho 2019, each milestone propelling me further into the exploration of genetic landscapes and bioinformatics.


## 💼 Professional Experience
- Currently working at BIH Charité Berlin and LaborBerlin, focusing on rare diseases of neuronal development, rare tumors, and kidney diseases.
- Senior Physician at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Translational Research Area - Research Group "Hypertension and Molecular Biology of Endocrine Tumors" since 07/2022.
- Previously Senior Physician and Head of the Genetics Outpatient Clinic at MVZ Dresden.
- Specialist in Human Genetics at the Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, and Deputy Team Leader Genetic Diagnostics - Clinical Genomics.
- DFG Rotation Position at the Human Genetics Institute of the University Hospital Leipzig, working on the project "Exome Pool-Seq and systems biology approach to identify and characterize genes and networks in neurodevelopmental disorders".
- Previously Resident and scientific-medical assistant at the Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.

## 🌱 Other Interests
Nature, science, and technology also play a big role in my personal life. I enjoy freediving, scuba diving, being in nature and I am a passionate photographer. Most recent hobby is finding fossil shark teeth around the world.

I love traveling and experiencing new things, trying to involve in local communities, cultures and citizen science.


### 🐋 Favorite Animals
Favorite animals: sharks 🦈, whales 🐋, and turtles 🐢.
